By default the module only support XML files of the format defined in this documentation.

If you get your XML flows from a supplier or if you want to use CSV flows, you have to make a "**template**".

A **template** translate CSV or XML flows into the format supported by PrestaShop XML & CSV Importer.

## Create a template

After [importing your flow](Import_Flows), you must see something like that:

If you try to create a template for an XML, the assistant will ask you to define the **xpath** of the items. In other words, the path to the node of the products:

If you try to create a template for a CSV, the assistant will ask you to define the **filepath** of the file name. Set *.csv if you don't know. This filepath, is a mask. This mask will be use to apply the template to your CSV files:
